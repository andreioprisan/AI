To run:

 - Problem 1:
 $ python problem1_Main.py


 - Problem 2:
 $ python problem2_Main.py


 - Problem 3:
 $ python problem3_Main.py



 ***** Notes:
The showing of plots pauses program execution until the plot is closed.

In part 1: after viewing the plot of the risk functions, close the plot window to see the output of the final calculations in the terminal window

In part 2: all svm plots are done in one window, and logistic regression and decision tree is shown in a second window. After viewing the svm plots, close the window to see the logistic regression and decision tree plot

In part 3: both the trees.png recreated and the clustered trees.png will appear at the same time (one window on top of the other). To continue program execution to spectral clustering, close both pictures of the trees


**** I posted this on Piazza and as of Tuesday (6/28) at 5pm have not received a response, but I note that in part 3, about 30% of the time the clustered trees image will have the colors inverted. By this, I mean that the dark areas in the original end up being the light areas in the recreation and the light areas in the original end up being the dark areas in the original. I'm not sure why this happens and wasn't able to track down a flaw in the code. I find that if I see this result, running the program again (maybe 2 more times) will produce the correct image that is shown in the write up.

THANK YOU! :)
